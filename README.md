# my-Current-Place-On-Google-Map-Swift
when you open the Google Map App you gonna see your current location ... here I mimic that :) 


first go to https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/startn  you gonna find (Get A Key) button in step 4 click on it and create your key

open the appDelegate file and replace "ADD YOUR KEY"  with your key 

done you can build and run :)
